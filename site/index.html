		<p class="c5" style="padding: 20px solid yellow; border: 30px solid blue; text-transform:justify;background-color: grey;  ">&quot;Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature for aesthetic purposes. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlight&quot;

&quot;Some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover from injuries more quickly, but competitions sometimes ban using them because of the health risks or considerations regarding fair competition. Despite some calls for testing for steroids, the leading bodybuilding federation (National Physique Committee) does not. The winner of the annual IFBB Mr. Olympia contest is generally recognized as the world's top male professional bodybuilder. Since 1950, the NABBA Universe Championships have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as Reg Park, Lee Priest, Steve Reeves, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Winners generally go on to become professional athletes&quot;</p>

	<p class="c6">&quot;Bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by German Eugen Sandow, now considered as the "Father of Modern Bodybuilding". He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in "muscle display performances". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, Florenz Ziegfeld. The Oscar-winning 1936 musical film The Great Ziegfeld depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;Chest training gotten stale? Here's a superset that'll change that.

Both exercises will leave your pecs screaming with tension in both the shortened and lengthened position. And before anyone asks, yes, you can do these exercises separately if you train in a sardine-packed commercial gym where supersets are impractical.

A1. Rotating Ring Push-Up

This is great for establishing a solid mind-muscle connection in just a few reps. You're able to get your chest stretched at the bottom while it fully shortens at the top.

Start with your hands pronated.
Lower your chest as you rotate your hands into a semi-supinated position.
Brace and keep stable as you push up.
Pronate your arms together and squeeze your chest at the top.
A2. Incline Cable Press to Eccentric Flye

This compound exercise isolates the pecs. It allows you to overload both lifting phases, especially the eccentric which often doesn't get enough action (unless special techniques are used). This overloading of the eccentric has also been shown to help with tightness and flexibility as well (1).

The incline position also allows you to bias the upper chest (clavicular head) a bit more.

Start by doing a cable press.
Then slowly transition to a flye position.
Release slowly as you let the fibers stretch under tension.
Reset and repeat.
Programming
Apply progressive overload on both of these exercises in the 8-15 rep range and your chest will puff up like a balloon. These two exercises can be done at the beginning, middle, or end of your workout. Don't overthink it. Just get stronger&quot;

	<p>&quot;welcome to the latest addition of "yeah, that's basically impossible." Today, we're examining the fitness goal many have attempted and few have actually achieved: le six pack.

If Instagram is any indication, six packs are as common as magical clear baby skin on adults and perfectly organized closets. But, like those things, they're hard to find IRL. If this makes you feel sad or maybe even mad at me, I'm sorry. But you should know that actual experts on fitness and nutrition things, like Stephen Ball, professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri, are on my side. “Very few people can achieve this look, regardless of what they do,” says Ball.

This content is imported from You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

Here's the that on that: Your rectus abdominis—my favorite muscle group on Jason Derulo—is typically covered by fat (because biology). And you can't uncover it by doing things like crunches and planks, Ball says. “It’s very unrealistic for most people to have body fat percentages low enough to see the abs.”

That, and I cannot stress this enough, is very much normal, and fine, and healthy, and truly the last thing you should worry about right now (or ever).

The best part about this news (besides validating your decision to never care about stomach muscles ever again), is that strengthening your abs is beneficial for your posture, prevents exercise-induced injuries from things like running, and enables you to hold an impressively-long plank. These are the things your abs WANT to do for you. Don't put those babies in a corner&quot;</p>
